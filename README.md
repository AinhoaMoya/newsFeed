## Highlights of this project

- I have included Sass for styling.
- I have divided components in two folders (components and containers). Components are mostly static and get their data from containers. Containers, as previously said, are mostly concerned with handling data, either from an API, Redux or, in this case, a json database.
- I have created a component / container for each of the UI elements I present in my mockup. As I have imagined it, the NewsFeed container would fetch and filter the data and then pass it to every other component in the page as props.
- I have not used Semantic UI. Mostly due to timing. I looked into its documentation, specially its grid, and I believe one can achieve similar results using Flexbox. I like this approach cause it allows more flexibility and control over the styling of our components.
